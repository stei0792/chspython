#In this repository I first suggest looking over the python.functions.table.docx and helpfulpythonscripts.ipynb 
#to get a better understanding of Python. If you want to use the USDA API (newusda.py) you must first run/save (pyusda.py), 
#the USDA.uri.codes.docx has the different state codes/etc. which you can change in the (newusda.py) script. 
#Also, some of the jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) are here too.
